					<h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
					<p>
						A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a
						'healthy weight'. Maintaining a healthy weight may
						lower your chances of experiencing health issues
						later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim
						for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
						content, incorporating sample fruits and
						vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
						physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily
						for five days a week.
